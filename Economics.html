                           <p>The law of demand states that <strong>when the price asked in exchange for a product is high, the demand for that product will be low, and when the price is low, the demand will be high</strong>. For supply, <strong>when the price offered to buy a product is high, the quantity supplied will be high, and when it is low the quantity supplied will be low</strong>. Demand represents the willingness to pay of consumers and supply represents the willingness of suppliers to accept a price. They both have an inverse relationship because both parties want to benefit the most out of a transaction, but a market is not about the benefit of one party alone, hence both parties have to compromise and the best compromise for both is the <a href="./Mathematics.html#Equilibrium">Equilibrium</a> point \(E_0\).</p>

                                 <p><bdi style="color: tomato;">&nbsp;if the price was higher than \(P_0\), then many suppliers would be willing to sell the product, thus quantity demanded for supply would be higher than \(Q_0\),</bdi> <bdi style="color: navy;">&nbsp;but fewer people would be willing to buy it hence, quantity demanded would be lower than \(Q_0\).</bdi> That&apos;s what the graph shows.</p>

                                 I love this model not only because of how intuitive it is but because a lot of other models in economics rely on the foundations built by it, plus the fact that can be applied to many other different situations on its own.<br>The reaction to price change of each type good is it the not same, if prices of both bread and sweets increased for example, people would still keep buying bread, but not sweets. This is referred to as the price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply, that is the sensitivity to price change of demand and supply respectively, they&apos;re the slopes or the gradients of the 2 curves. If the graph is steeper then it is more inelastic and vice versa.

An increase in tax would have the opposite effect <em>(consumers would pay more for less quantity)</em> and the supply curve would shift to the left.</p>
                                 <p>On the right, <bdi style="color: navy;">&nbsp;If there is an economic downturn or increase in demand for a rivalry product, the quantity demanded of a product would decline and suppliers would have to supply less which would lead to equilibrium \(E_1\).</bdi> If the population increases or the economy improves however, the quantity demanded would rise and the demand curve would shift to the right .</p>

                           <p>In economics, a contrast is made between absolute and competitive advantage, <strong>absolute advantage refers to the ability to produce more goods or services than someone else, while comparative advantage refers to an ability to produce more goods and services at a lower opportunity cost</strong>.</p>
                           <p>For example, suppose Martha and Henry have to collect some fire logs catch some fish. Henry can catch 12 fish and collect 8 fire logs in a day, and Martha can catch 6 fish and collect 7 fire logs in a day. This would mean Henry has an absolute advantage in both activities, while Martha has a comparative advantage in collecting fire logs. The graph of the possible combinations of things they could get done in a day would look like this, where A is one possible combination.</p>
                           <figure>

                                 <p>So the question now is what is the most efficient combination from this graph? According to this model, the 2 will be more productive if each person focuses on something they have a comparative advantage in <em>(i.e., Henry only does fishing and Martha only collects fire logs)</em>, as it would result in less opportunity costs, <bdi style="color: navy;">&nbsp;this happens at point B and as you can see, B is higher than any point produced by the line which shows when the two share the tasks instead&nbsp;</bdi>. This model, like many other micro economics models, also applies to firms and economies as well, and it implies a firm or an economy will be overall more productive if we all did what we do best, even when there are other people who can do it better than us, really makes you think huh?.</p>

In this case, there is a marginal product of capital, \( M_{PK}= \frac{\partial Y}{\partial K}=F_K \) and marginal product of labour, \( M_{PL}= \frac{\partial Y}{\partial L}=F_L \) .</p>

                           <h4>Assumptions of the model</h4>
                           <p>The <strong>Solow model</strong> is an <strong>economic model that analyses the economic growth and development of various countries</strong>, it helps us tackle the biggest question in macro economics, <em>why are other countries poor while others are rich</em> ?</p>
                           <hr>
                           <h4>Assumptions of the model</h4>
                           <p>The model is based on 2 equations. The <b style="color: Navy;">production function</b> which I already talked about <a href="#Production%20Function">here</a> and the <b style="color: red;">capital accumulation equation</b>. The production function is assumed to have a <strong>Cobb Douglas</strong> form which is: <b style="color: Navy;">\(Y=F(K,L)=K^&alpha;L^{1-&alpha;}\)</b> . The Cobb Douglas production form exhibits a <strong>constant return to scale</strong>(i.e., double input =double output). We assume firms operate under <strong>perfect competition</strong>(i.e.,price takers, large number of firms, etc).</p>
                           <p>The <strong>cost function</strong> is given by <strong>\(Y=wL+rK\)</strong>, like the <a href="#Isocost%20Lines">Isocost</a> I explained here. Hence, profit is given by \( F(K,L)-rK-wL\), in which \( {&part;F\over&part;L}\)=0 and \( {&part;F\over&part;K}\)=0, will give us: \( w={&part;F\over&part;L} =(1-&alpha;){Y\over L}\) and \( r={&part;F\over&part;K} =&alpha;{Y\over K}\) . this tells us that <strong>firms will hire labour until Marginal Product of Labour=wages paid</strong> and buy capital until <strong>Marginal Product of Capital=rent paid</strong>. hence, the share of output paid to labour is \( w{L\over Y}=(1-&alpha;)\) , and the share of output paid to capital is \( r{K\over Y}=&alpha;\) . Now suppose <b style="color:Navy ;">output per worker</b> is <b style="color: navy;">&nbsp;\( y={Y\over L}\)</b> and <b style="color: skyblue;">output per capital</b> <b style="color: skyblue;">\( k={K\over L}\)</b> . <b style="color: blue;">$$\therefore y={K^{&alpha;}L^{1-&alpha;}\over L}={K^{&alpha;}\over L^{&alpha;}}=k^{&alpha;} $$</b> With the following graph:</p>
                           <figure>
                              <img src="./Files/Graphs/Graph21-Cobbdouglass.png" style="width: 55%;">
                              <figure>
                                 <b style="color: Navy;">The graph illustrates diminishing marginal returns to capital per worker. Firms produce more output per worker with more capital per worker. But as they add more capital per worker, output per worker increases by less and less.</b>
                                 <hr>
                                 <p>The second equation is the <b style="color: red;">capital accumulation</b> : <b style="color: red;">\( \dot{K}=sY-&delta;K\)</b> , Which means change in capital stock \( \dot{K}\) , equals the amount of <b style="color: red;">investments(sY)</b>, minus <b style="color: red;">depreciation(&delta;K)</b>.<em>(we assume the only use of investment in this economy is to acquire capital)</em>.</p>
                                 <p>To write capital accumulation in per worker terms. We use the method of taking logarithms on both sides then find the derivatives. For capital per worker: $$ k={K\over L} \Rightarrow log(k)=log(K)-log(L) $$ $$ \Rightarrow {\dot{k}\over k}={\dot{K}\over K}-{\dot{L}\over L} $$ and for output per worker: $$ y=k^{&alpha;} \Rightarrow log(y)=&alpha;log(k) $$ $$ \Rightarrow{\dot{y}\over y}=&alpha;{\dot{k}\over k} $$ $$ \Rightarrow{\dot{k}\over k}={sY-&delta;K\over K}-{\dot{L}\over L} $$ $$ \Rightarrow {sY\over K}-&delta;-n $$</p>
                                 <p>\({\dot{L}\over L}=n\) because we assume the labour force is constant and <strong>change in the labour force is proportional to the population growth n</strong>. <b style="color: red;">$$\therefore \dot{k} ={sy}-(&delta;+n)k $$</b> is our <b style="color: red;">change in capital per worker</b>. It <b style="color: red;">tells us that change in capital per worker is positively affected by the investment per worker, sy, and negatively affected by depreciation per worker, &delta;k, and population growth, nk</b>.</p>
                                 <hr>
                                 <p><u>Solving the Solow model:</u> using output per worker and capital accumulation per worker equations, we find the <a href="./Mathematics.html#Equilibrium">Equilibrium or steady state</a> where change in <b style="color: red;">capital per worker</b>, <bdi style="color: red;">\(\dot{k}=0\)</bdi> <bdi style="color: blue;">$$y=k^{&alpha;}$$</bdi> <b style="color: red;">$$ \dot{k} ={sy}-(&delta;+n)k $$</b>&nbsp;$$\Rightarrow 0={sy}-(&delta;+n)k $$ $$\Rightarrow sk^{&alpha;}=(&delta;+n)k $$ $$\Rightarrow ({s\over {n+ &delta;}})=k^{1-&alpha;} $$ $$\Rightarrow ({s\over {n+ &delta;}})^{1\over{1-&alpha;}}=k $$ $$\Rightarrow ({s\over {n+ &delta;}})^{&alpha;\over{1-&alpha;}}=k^{&alpha;}=y $$</p>
                                 <p>$$\therefore y=({s\over {n+ &delta;}})^{&alpha;\over{1-&alpha;}} $$</p>
                                 According to the Solow steady state \(y\), countries with higher levels of investments<em>(s)</em>, low population growth <em>(n)</em> and low rates of capital depreciation<em>(&delta;)</em> have higher incomes per worker<em>(y)</em>. As such, increasing population growth reduces the capital per worker accumulation.

                                 <p>The Solow diagram consists of two curves,<b style="color: navy;">investment per person, sy&nbsp;</b> and <b style="color: red;">the amount of new investments per person required to keep the amount of capital per worker constant (n + &delta;)k .</b> <strong>The steady state is where the 2 curves meet, where sy=(n + &delta;)k</strong>. the difference between the 2 curves is change in capital, \(\dot{k}=sy-(n + &delta;)k\). Suppose an economy begins \(k_0\), then the economy will grow, between \(k_0\) and \(k_1\). but the closer it gets to \(k_1\)<em>(the steady state)</em>, the slower it will grow, then eventually stop \(k_1\).

                              A <b>bubble</b> is an economic period where an asset’s price rapidly increases
                              beyond its true value, often due to speculation or high optimism in the
                              asset, followed by a sudden, sharp decline, also referred to as a bubble
                              burst. This phenomenon is referred to as a bubble because the asset’s price
                              during this bubble period is inflated by nothing substantial, like air, and
                              is fragile, able to burst at any moment, much like a bubble. Economic
                              bubbles have been noted to be difficult to detect in real-time until they

                              Suppose there is a competitive market for an asset, the demand curve of the
                              asset will have the equation: \(Q_{t}^{d1} =a-bP_{t}\), and the supply curve
                              will have the equation: \(Q_{t}^{s} =c+dP_{t}\), where \(Q_{t}^{d1}\) is the
                              quantity demanded, \(Q_{t}^{s}\) is the quantity supplied and  \(P_{t}\) is
                              the asset price. The functions have parameters a, b, c, and d, all greater
                              than 0. Now, as you can see from the graph below, the market price when the
                              demand is \(Q_{t}^{d1}\) is \(E_1\).
                           </p>

                              =a-bP_{t}+sE_{t}\). This shows that the demand for the asset depends not

                              increase in the near future(\(sE_{t}\)). The more the price of the asset is
                              expected to rise (\(sE_{t}\)), the greater the quantity of the asset
                              \((Q_{t}^{d2}\)) that people wish to purchase with the expectation of making
                              a profitable future sale. The new market price when the demand is
                              \(Q_{t}^{d2}\) is \(E_2\), with a greater price \(P_2\).

                              Regarded as the earliest documented asset bubble. Tulips were highly prized in Europe for their beauty and the prestige they
                              conveyed. In the 1600s, a botanist observed that tulips sometimes bloomed
                              with striking streaks or flames of color from season to season(see the picture on the right below).

                              In modern times, this phenomenon is referred to as the Tulip breaking virus,
                              but at the time, these infected flowers grew in demand among the wealthy,
                              greatly exceeding their supply and making their prices climb. However, since
                              these flowers had a virus, their lifespan was short, so the supply was
                              gradually declining, increasing their rarity and their prices even more.
                              This was referred to as the Tulip mania. During that period. Houses and
                              businesses were sold, so that tulips could be purchased and resold at higher
                              prices. Some Tulip sales were made multiple times over without ever leaving
                              the ground. The bubble kept growing until 1637, when it burst, and most
                              people could no longer afford even the cheapest flowers and people began
                              having doubts as to whether the prices would keep increasing, and the demand
                              dropped. Another thing that contributed to the burst was the fact that many
                              people had purchased the flowers on loans with the hopes of repaying said
                              loans after reselling their purchased flowers at a higher price, but as
                              prices slowly declined, they were forced to sell them at any price.

                           <p>
                              The period of 1990-2000 was when the internet took the world by storm, more
                              people than ever were using the internet and technology, and it was becoming
                              the new norm, especially in the US. As a result, during this period, there
                              was an excessive increase in stock market valuation in internet services and
                              technology companies, representing the enthusiasm of investors in internet
                              services and the willingness of venture capitalists to invest in IPOs of
                              internet start-ups, many of whose share prices then skyrocketed.                               Such investor overconfidence and fear of missing out on the growing use of
                              the internet led the shares of dot-com companies to be priced far more than
                              the values that traditional assessment factors would have justified, leading
                              to investors pouring money into debt-ridden companies that had no realistic
                              hope of returning profit.

                              There are many contributing factors as to why the bubble eventually broke in
                              early 2000, but the most notable one was that after the U.S. Federal Reserve
                              announced a modest increase in interest rates to stave off inflationary
                              pressures, investors in dot-com companies began a panicked sell-off of their
                              holdings, and the shares of many of these companies began to plummet.

                              <h4><u>3. The U.S. Housing Bubble</u></h4>
                           <p>
                              Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the US government encouraged
                              homeownership and supported policies that enabled banks and lending
                              institutions to offer mortgages to more people, including those with low
                              credit scores and individuals without the means to follow through on the
                              mortgages they were granted. This led to an increasing demand for mortgages,
                              and as the demand continued to grow rapidly, so did the house prices,
                              forcing people to take high-risk loans.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Financial institutions pooled these risky subprime loans into
                              mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and sold them to investors worldwide. At
                              the time, people who took these high-risk loans believed they were safe
                              because, as the prices of these houses kept increasing, they could always
                              borrow against the increased value of their homes or sell their homes at a
                              profit to pay off their mortgage.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              On the other hand, banks and lenders thought they were safe because they
                              could always repossess the property and sell it for more than the amount of
                              the original loan; hence, the <strong>bubble kept expanding</strong>.
                              However, once interest rates began to rise and housing prices started to
                              drop moderately in 2006–2007 in many parts of the US, borrowers were unable
                              to refinance. And adjustable-rate mortgage interest rates rose, leading to
                              the bubble bursting. The US housing bubble was one of the contributing
                              factors of the 2008 global recession.
