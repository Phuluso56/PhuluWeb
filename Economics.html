									<h2 class="Ecoh2">Demand and Supply</h2>
									<div Class="EcoSubTopics">
									<p>The law of demand states that <b>when the price asked in exchange for a product is high, the demand for that product will be low, and when the price is low, the demand will be high</b>. For supply, <b>when the price offered to buy a product is high, the quantity supplied will be high, and when it is low the quantity suppllied will be low</b>. Demand represents the willingness to pay of consumers and supply represents the willingness of suppliers to accept a price. They both have an inverse relationship because both parties want to benefit the most out of a transaction, but a market is not about the benefit  of one party alone, hence both parties have to compromise and the best compromise for both is the <a href="./Mathematics.html#Equilibrium">Equilibrium</a> point \(E_0\).<hr></p>
									<figure><img src="./Files/Graphs/Graph04-Demand-Supply.png" style="width:55%"  /><figure/>
									<p><bdi style="color: tomato;"> if the price was higher than \(P_0\), then many suppliers would be willing to sell the product, thus quantity demanded for supply would be higher than \(Q_0\),</bdi> <bdi style="color: navy;"> but fewer people would be willing to buy it hence, quantity demanded would be lower than \(Q_0\).</bdi> That's what the graph shows.<hr> I love this model not only because of how intuitive it is but because a lot of other models in economics rely on the foundations built by it, plust the fact that can be applied to many other different situations on its own.<br> The reaction to price change of each type good is it the not same, if prices of  both bread and sweets increased for example, people would still keep buying bread, but not sweets. This is referred to as the price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply, that is the sensitivity to price change of demand and supply respectively, they're the slopes or the gradients of the 2 curves. If the graph is steeper then it is more inelastic and vice versa.</p><hr>
									<h4><u>Changes in demand and Supply</u></h4>

									<p>On the left, <bdi style="color: tomato;"> If a new technology is discovered for example, and it makes producing things easier and faster, then suppliers would produce more quantity, \(Q_1\). but since nothing has changed with the buyers, they'd have to decrease the prices to prevent an excess of stock, hence new equilibrium \(E_1\).</bdi> It would initially benefit buyers more, according to this model anyway. An increase in tax would have the opposite effect <em>(consumers would pay more for less quantity)</em> and the supply curve would shift to the left.</p>
									<p>On the right, <bdi style="color: navy;"> If there is an economic downturn or increase in demand for a rivalry product, the quantity demanded of a product would decline and suppliers would have to supply less which would lead to equilibrium \(E_1\).</bdi> If the population increases or the economy improves however, the quantity demanded would rise and the demand curve would shift to the right .</p>

								<div id="Comparative and Absolute advantage">
									<h2 class="Ecoh2">Comparative and Absolute advantage</h2>
									<div class="EcoSubTopics">
									<p>In economics, a contrast is made between absolute and competitive advantage, <b>absolute advantage refers to the ability to produce more goods or services  than someone else, while comparative advantage refers to an ability to produce more goods and services at a lower opportunity cost</b>.</p>
									<p>For example, suppose Martha and Henry have to collect some fire logs catch some fish. Henry can catch 12 fish and collect 8 fire logs in a day, and Martha can catch 6 fish and collect 7 fire logs in a  day. This would mean Henry has an absolute advantage in both activities, while Martha has a comparative advantage in collecting fire logs. The graph of the possible combinations of things they could get done in a day would look like this, where A is one possible combination. </p>
									<figure><img src="./Files/Graphs/Graph07-TaskDevision.png" style="width:55%"/><figure/>
									<p>So the question now is what is the most efficient combination from this graph? According to this model, the 2 will be more productive if each person focuses on something they have a comparative advantage in <em>(i.e., Henry only does fishing and Martha only collects fire logs)</em>, as it would result in less opportunity costs, <bdi style="color: navy;"> this happens at point B and as you can see, B is higher than any point produced by the line which shows when the two share the tasks instead </bdi>. This model, like many other micro economics models, also applies to firms and economies as well, and it implies a firm or an economy will be overall more productive if we all did what we do best, even when there are other people who can do it better than us, really makes you think huh?.</p>

									<p>An economy is a complex system with many different sectors interacting with and influencing each other, and there's nothing more useful than linear algebra when it comes to complex interacting systems. One economic model that makes use of that is the <b>input-output analysis method</b> invented by Harvard economist Wassily Leontief in the 1930s but still widely used by corporations, cities and countries for economic planning and forecasting.<hr></p>
									<p>Suppose we have a region which consists of 3 industries: The Farming, Manufacturing and service industry, each industry purchases commodities from other industries including itself in order to <bdi style="color: green;">generate output</bdi><em>(i.e., farmers using some of their own crops to feed their cattle, then buying some farming equipment from the manufacturing industry and paying for transport services to transport their goods)</em>.

									<p><bdi style="color: red;">From the table we see that the service industry spends<em>(consumes)</em> 0.2 on the farming industry, 0.4 on the manufacturing industry and 0.3 on itself</bdi>.<bdi style="color: green;">On the other hand they offer<em>(produce)</em> 0.2 services to the farming industry, 0.2 to the manufacturing industry and 0.4 on the service industry itself. </bdi> Theres also a demand for R 0.8 million worth of service exports.<br>
										Now, let total output for farming=\(x_1\), manufacturing=\(x_2\), service=\(x_3\). Since the economy is in <b>Equilibrium</b>, the total expense<em>(used on inputs for production)</em> of the service industry is equal total revenue<em>(recieved from total outputs sold)</em>. Doing this for every industry we get the following system :
										</p>
									<p>&#x2780;$$ 0.2x_1+0.1x_2+0.2x_3+1=x_1$$
										$$0.1x_1+0.1x_2+0.2x_3+1.2=x_2$$
										$$0.2x_1+0.4x_2+0.3x_3+0.8=x_3$$
										</p><hr>
									<p>&#x2781;$$ 0.8x_1-0.1x_2-0.2x_3=1$$
										$$-0.1x_1+0.9x_2-0.2x_3=1.2$$
										$$-0.2x_1-0.4x_2+0.7x_3=0.8$$
										</p><hr>

									<p>&#x2782; Which gives us the following augmented matrix $$\left[ 
										\begin{array}{ccc|c}
											0.8 & -0.1 &-0.2& 1 \\
											-0.1 & 0.9 & -0.2&1.2 \\
											-0.2 & -0.4 &0.7& 0.8 \\

									&#x2783; $$\left[

											1 & 0 &0& 2.13 \\
											0 & 1 & 0&2.28 \\
											0 & 0 &1& 3.11\\
										\end{array}
									\right]$$<hr>
									</p>
									<p>Hence the Farming industry will have to  produce R2.23 million worth of output, the Manufacturing industry will have to produce 2.28 million and the service industry will have to produce R3.11 million. If there are more industries operating in the economic system,a larger system of equations would be needed. This model also works for a single business with many departments or for a single person trying to  make a budget.</p>
									<h4><u>Other mathematical properties of the model</u></h4>
									<p>The system is of the form \(X=Cx+d\). 
										X is the production vector, C is the consumption vector <em>(it is a stochastic or probability type matrix)</em> , x is the feasible solution and d is the demand vector.
										</p>
									<ol><li>C is productive if and only if there exists vector \(x\ge 0\) such that \(x\ge Cx\)</li>
									<li>The consumption matrix is productive if for identity matrix I, I-C is invertible and \((I-C)^{-1}\ge 0\)</li>
									<li>If the sum of each row or column is less than 1, then C is productive.</li></ol>

									<div class="EcoSubTopics">
									<h4>Assumptions of the model </h4>
									<p>The <b>Solow model</b> is an  <b>economic model that analyses the economic growth and development of various countries</b>, it helps us tackle the biggest question in macro economics, <em>why are other countries poor while others are rich</em> ?</p><hr>
									<h4>Assumptions of the model</h4>
									<p> The model is based on 2  equations. The <b style="color: Navy;">production function</b> which I already talked about <a href="#Production Function">here</a> and the <b style="color: red;">capital accumulation equation</b>. The production function is assumed to have a <b>Cobb Douglas</b> form which is:  <b style="color: Navy;">\(Y=F(K,L)=K^αL^{1-α}\)</b> . The Cobb Douglas production form exhibits a <b>constant return to scale</b>(i.e., double input =double output). We assume firms operate under <b>perfect competition</b>(i.e.,price takers, large number of firms, etc).</p>
									<p>The <b>cost function</b> is given by <b>\(Y=wL+rK\)</b>, like the  <a href="#Isocost Lines">Isocost</a> I explained here. Hence, profit is given by \( F(K,L)-rK-wL\), in which \( {∂F\over∂L}\)=0 and \( {∂F\over∂K}\)=0, will give us: \( w={∂F\over∂L} =(1-α){Y\over L}\)   and  \( r={∂F\over∂K} =α{Y\over K}\) . this tells us that <b>firms will hire labour until Marginal Product of Labour=wages paid</b>  and buy capital until <b>Marginal Product of Capital=rent paid</b>. hence, the share of output paid to labour is \( w{L\over Y}=(1-α)\) , and the share of output paid to capital is \( r{K\over Y}=α\) . Now suppose <b style="color:Navy ;">output per worker</b> is <b style="color: navy;"> \( y={Y\over L}\)</b>  and <b style="color: skyblue;">output per capital</b> <b style="color: skyblue;">\( k={K\over L}\)</b> . <b style="color: blue;">$$\therefore y={K^{α}L^{1-α}\over L}={K^{α}\over L^{α}}=k^{α} $$</b> With the following graph:</p>
									<figure><img src="./Files/Graphs/Graph21-Cobbdouglass.png" style="width:55%"/><figure/>
									<b style="color: Navy;">The graph illustrates diminishing marginal returns to capital per worker. Firms produce more output per worker with more capital per worker. But as they add more capital per worker, output per worker increases  by less and less.</b><hr>
									<p>The second equation is the <b style="color: red;">capital accumulation</b> : <b style="color: red;">\( \dot{K}=sY-δK\)</b> , Which means change in capital stock \( \dot{K}\) , equals the amount of <b style="color: red;">investments(sY)</b>, minus <b style="color: red;">depreciation(δK)</b>.<em>(we assume the only use of investment in this economy is to acquire capital)</em>.</p>
									<p>To write capital accumulation in per worker terms. We use the method of taking logarithms on both sides then find the derivatives. For capital per worker: $$ k={K\over L} \Rightarrow log(k)=log(K)-log(L) $$   $$ \Rightarrow {\dot{k}\over k}={\dot{K}\over K}-{\dot{L}\over L}  $$   and for output per worker: $$ y=k^{α} \Rightarrow log(y)=αlog(k)
										$$  $$ \Rightarrow{\dot{y}\over y}=α{\dot{k}\over k}  $$  $$ \Rightarrow{\dot{k}\over k}={sY-δK\over K}-{\dot{L}\over L} $$  $$  \Rightarrow {sY\over K}-δ-n $$
									   </p>

									<p>\({\dot{L}\over L}=n\) because we assume the labour force is constant and <b>change in the labour force is proportional to the population growth n</b>.
										<b  style="color: red;">$$\therefore \dot{k} ={sy}-(δ+n)k $$</b> is our <b style="color: red;">change in capital per worker</b>. It <b style="color: red;">tells us that change in capital per worker is positively affected by the investment per worker, sy, and negatively affected by  depreciation per worker, δk, and population growth, nk</b>.
										</p><hr>
									<p><u>Solving the Solow model:</u> using output per worker and capital accumulation per worker equations, we find the <a href="./Mathematics.html#Equilibrium">Equilibrium or steady state</a> where change in <b style="color: red;">capital per worker</b>, <bdi style="color: red;">\(\dot{k}=0\)</bdi>  <bdi style="color: blue;">$$y=k^{α}$$</bdi>
										 <b style="color: red;">$$ \dot{k} ={sy}-(δ+n)k $$</b>  $$\Rightarrow 0={sy}-(δ+n)k
										$$  $$\Rightarrow sk^{α}=(δ+n)k   $$  $$\Rightarrow ({s\over {n+ δ}})=k^{1-α}
										$$  $$\Rightarrow ({s\over {n+ δ}})^{1\over{1-α}}=k   $$
									   $$\Rightarrow ({s\over {n+ δ}})^{α\over{1-α}}=k^{α}=y
										$$  <p>$$\therefore y=({s\over {n+ δ}})^{α\over{1-α}} $$</p>
										According to the Solow steady state \(y\), countries with higher levels of investments<em>(s)</em>, low population growth <em>(n)</em> and low rates of capital depreciation<em>(δ)</em> have higher incomes per worker<em>(y)</em>. As such, increasing population growth reduces the capital per worker accumulation.</p>	
										<p><b>A graphical representation:</b></p>
										<figure><img src="./Files/Graphs/Graph22-Solow diagram.png" style="width: 55%;"></figure>
										<p>The Solow diagram consists of two curves,<b style="color: navy;">investment per person, sy </b> and <b style="color: red;">the amount of new investments per person required to keep the amount of capital per worker constant (n + δ)k .</b> <b>The steady state is where the 2 curves meet, where sy=(n + δ)k</b>. the difference between the 2 curves is change in capital, \(\dot{k}=sy-(n + δ)k\). Suppose an economy begins \(k_0\), then the economy will grow, between \(k_0\) and  \(k_1\). but the closer it gets to \(k_1\)<em>(the steady state)</em>, the slower it will grow, then eventually stop \(k_1\). So basically the economy <a href="./Mathematics.html#Convergence%20and%20Equilibrium">converges</a> to the steady state</b>.<em>(that is 1 flaw of the basic solow model however, it does not explain sustained economic growth. the model has many refined variations however, which account for some of the flaws basic solow model. )</em>  </p>
										<h4>Here's one example of the steady state of one of the solow variants:</h4>
										<p>$$y(t)=({s_k\over {n+ δ+g}})^{α\over{1-α}}({µ\over g}e^{ψµ})^{1\overγ}A(t) $$</p>
										<p>According to this steady state, <u>the things that help improve an economy are:</u></p>
										<li>High levels of <b>investment(\(s_k\))</b>.</li>
										<li>High levels of <b>technology(\(A(t)\))</b><em>(Technology is the key to sustained economic growth, as long as technology keeps improving, the economy will keep growing, it will not stuctk in the steady state, like with the basic Solow model. According to this model, AI development will help improve our lives... )</em>.</li>
										<li>High numbers <b>skilled labour(µ)</b> <em>(that can effectively use said technology)</em>.</li>
										<li>Spending more time <b>acquiring skills\(e^{ψu}\)</b><em>(education)</em>.</li>
										<li>Being an open economy that is able to <b>import(m)</b> capital goods to improve productivity.</li>
										<li><b>Low levels of capital depreciation(δ)</b><em>(depreciation is high when there is poor maintainance... *cough* Eskom *cough*).</em></li>
										<li><b>Steady population growth rates(g)</b>.</li>
