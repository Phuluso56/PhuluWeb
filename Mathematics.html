									<h4>Weber -Fencher laws in psychometrics</h4>
									<p>If you are carrying 100 books and someone adds 1 book to your load you probably wouldn't notice the difference vs if you were carrying just one book right? That's what the Weber-Fencher laws tell us regarding stimulus as a whole. The Weber law says in order for us to tell the difference, there has to be a 2% change in the stimulus, for example if there's 10 spoons of sugar in a cup of tea, you have to add 0.2 of a spoon to feel any change, if there is 100 however you have to add 2 spoons, if you add one you won't feel a difference according to the theory. And it accounts for all other sensations too, hearing, seeing, smelling and touching.</p>

									<figcaption>same number of dots was increased but it's more apparent on the left. (image source: wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber–Fechner_law)</figcaption>
									<p>Then there's the Fencher method which says there's a logarithmic relationship between the perceived strength and the stimulus strength, hence the change in perceived stimulus declines the stronger a stimulus gets since the derivative of log(x) declines for positive values. kind of like diminishing marginal utility. Economists have also used these theories to study some consumer behaviour</p>

									<h4>The exponential model of memory retention</h4>
									<p>According to many psychologists, the ability to retain what you just learned declines quickly at first then levels off as time goes on. According to a Wixted and Besen study of 1991 it can be represented by an exponential model p=aexp(-bx) where p is the probability of a person being able to correctly recall an item learned. X is the time since learning it. And 0< a< 1 being the baseline retention before time passed, b>0 is the rate of retention drops with time, if your b is lower your probability of retention drops at a lower rate. So don't start studying the day before your exams basically.</p>

									<div id="Mathematics and Love">
									<h2 class="love">Mathematics and Love</h2>
									<p>If you were to ask someone about the relationship between maths and love they'd probably tell you about how much they hate it…( I swear the joke sounded better in my head). Anyway…:.</p>
									<p>There's a formula for the socially acceptable dating age difference between men and women and it is Age/2+7. So if a person is 30 the youngest person they should date is 30/2+7=15+7=22. The formula is a y=mx+c type graph hence the acceptable age difference keeps rising the older the 2 people  are as you can see from the graph.</p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/Half-age-plus-seven-relationship-rule.png" width="300" height="324" />(image source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships).<figure/>
									<p> Apparently this formula has been around since the early 1900s however, it was not meant to be for the youngest age a person should date like it's used today, but the ideal age of a partner for a man, which is interesting. Studies have shown it's fairly accurate but only when the man is the older person. According to a USA study from 2017 a huge majority of married couples in the US have an age gap of 1-3  and that is more common in many other countries too.</p>
									
									<h4>The Mathematics of Marital Conflict, 1998 study by John Gottman, Catherine Swanson, and James Murray. </h4>
									<p>50% of married American couples end in divorce and some researchers did a study on why this happens by putting couples and letting them talk while they analysed their conversations, facial expressions and many other factors and then made a mathematical model that predicts whether or not they’ll end in divorce.</p>
									<ol><li><h5>Summary of the process</h5></li>
									<p>They computed for each conversation turn. Behaviour was considered positive if it correlated positively with marital happiness and negative otherwise. Rapid couples interaction scoring system (RCISS) and The Specific Affect Coding System(SPAFF) was used to create numerical values of the behaviours. The sequence of scores were Wt,Ht,Wt+1,Ht+1.Ht  is the husband variable at time t and Wt is for the wife(so it's: wife talks, husband responds,  wife responds and so on.)</p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/Husband and wife Equations.png"/>(image source: https://www.johngottman.net<figure/>
									<p> a, b and r are the parameters estimated from the data. r is the emotional inertia, which is the tendency of the person to remain in the same state over a period of time. a and b is the initial uninfluenced level of positivity minus negativity each spouse brings to the interaction. The “Is" are the influence of the functions. Once the r1,r2,a and b are estimated from the data (a+r1Wt)&(a+r2Ht) is then subtracted from the equations and the remainder is the influence function which was then ploted.</p>
									
									<li><h5>Analysis of the graphs</h5></li>
									<p>There are 2 types of graphs for both husband and wife(one type is for a couple that ends in divorce and one type is for a couple that has a lasting marriage), but we'll focus on the 2 types of  husbands in a couple since the graphs are the same for the wives.</p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/NegativityThreashold.png" />(image source: https://www.johngottman.net<figure/>
									<p> Graph A and B represent the influence the husbands have on their wives, what the husband does is the x-axis and the wife's reaction is the y-axis. In graph A, the husband has no influence on her until he does or says something at P or -P, then he gets either a big positive or a big negative reaction .And in B, the husband in a different  couple, gets a little reaction for everything he does, either positive or negative,  so the growth is linear.  Before we move one in your  opinion, what couple do you think would have a longer lasting marriage?</p>
									
									<li><h5>Conclusions from the findings</h5></li></ol>
									<p>They used the term “threshold of negativity” which  is the point at which negativity has an impact on the partners immediately following the behaviour. Apparently a low threshold like in B means couples end up happy and stable. It is the negativity detector effect, spouses responding to negative behaviour when it is less escalated.</p>
									<p>With couples of graphs A, they accept negativity. Setting their threshold for a response at a higher level or more negative level, then blowing up when they've had enough, and if the negativity threshold is really high, it means either the husband or wife has to become really aggressive to get a proper reaction from their spouse in an argument, which is a high risk factor for divorce, meanwhile couples in graph B who see a problem and immediately bring it up before it escalates too high usually have a longer lasting marriage, it was compared to how it's better to go to the hospital immediately when you notice a symptom and not when a disease gets worse. The bible verse Ephesians 4:26 ‘’Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,’’, was stated to support this. On the contrary though some studies have suggested that couples can cultivate an empathetic response to their partner's negativity, but they didn't say anything about that leading to a longer lasting marriage.</p>

									<h4>Computed Tomography</h4>
									<p>Computed Tomography scanner, commonly known as CT scanning is a radiographic imaging technique that generates cross sectional images of organs and tissue structures. An X-ray tube rotates, scans and performs measurements from different angles which is then sent to a computer that does a mathematical algorithm and solves a certain integral then gives results, it is used for diagnosing patients and with checkups. Maths used includes the radon and the fourier transform, fourier slice theorem, some numerical methods and other mathematical techniques.</p>

									<h4>Global positioning system</h4>
									<p>Global positioning system also known as GPS, helps solve the main problem of navigation with maps, which is where you are on the map. It uses trilateration which is based upon measuring distances, using geometry and trigonometry. Satellites transmit radio signals containing the time the signal was sent and the location of the satellite, the signals are then received by GPS receivers  like our phones. Since the electromagnetic waves travel through the speed of light they arrive after a certain time duration, We find the distance by multiplying the speed of light and the time it took the signal to arrive[d=S×(received time-sent time). Then spherical geometry and 2 other satelites is used to find the position of the GPS. </p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/Satellite.jpg" width="381" height="256" />(Image source: https://www.scienceabc.com/innovation/how-gps-global-positioning-system-works-satellite-smartphone.html)<figure/>
									<p>4 satellites are actually needed because there's a time offset between our phones and atomic clocks used by satellites. So a 4th satellite and  some calculus is used to calculate the offset time. Satellites are placed in a way that we can access at least 4 wherever we are which is pretty cool. Einstein's theory of relativity also plays a factor since satellites orbit the earth at really fast speeds and experience less of the earth's gravity which affects their atomic clocks.  These conditions are however  integrated to the computers that do these calculations thus accounting for the rates of the atomic clocks. If this wasn't done there'd be an added error of 10km every day which is crazy to think about. Mathematicians, engineers and scientists are the real unappreciated heroes of our modern world honestly. </p>

									<h4>Median Voter Theorem</h4>
									<p>the median voter theorem states that political parties that cater to the median or average person in a group of people are more likely to win, because if for example a party tries to cater too much to the rich people they might lose voters from the poorer group and if they cater to the poor they'll  lose votes from the rich, but if they cater to the middle persons though they'll  get  votes from middle people,  some votes from rich people and some from the poor who are willing to compromise vs a party that only caters to and gets votes from one side. It's not just rich and poor that play a factor to who the middle person is but also a wider range of ideologies and/or policies. I learnt about this little theory in second year economics and it also applies to businesses too, sometimes even movies. The model has some obvious flaws though that I won't get into, but you can go and learn more about it if you're interested. </p>

									<div id="Mathematics and Economics"></div>
									<h2 class="economics">Mathematics and Economics</h2>
									<h4>There's far too many uses of mathematics in economics, too many and  to write all about at once, so for now I'll start with a simpler topic, which is easier to understand but also really useful in economics and our lives in general,  and that is demand and supply.</h4>
									<p>The law of demand is very straightforward, it states when the price asked in exchange for the product is high the demand for that product will be low and when the price is low the demand will be high. For supply when the price offered to buy the product is high the supply will be high and when it is low the price supply will be low. Demand represents the willingness to pay of consumers.And supply represents the willingness of suppliers to accept a price. And they both have an inverse relationship because both parties want to benefit the most out of a transaction. but a market is not about the benefit  of 1 party alone. Hence both parties have to compromise and the best compromise for both is the equilibrium point E0.</p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/Demand and Supply Equilibrium.png" width="300" height="324" /><figure/>
									<p> if the price was higher than p0, then many suppliers would be willing to sell the product, quantity demanded for supply would be higher than Q0, but less people would be willing to buy it hence quantity demanded would be lower than Q0. That's what the graph shows. I really love this model because of how much a lot of other models in economics rely on the foundations built by it, and because this model can be applied to so many things on its own. The reaction to price change of each type good is it the not same, if prices of  both bread and sweets increased, people would still keep buying bread but not sweets .The sensitivity to price change of demand and supply is called price elasticity of demand  and price elasticity of supply respectively, they're the slopes or gradient of the 2 curves. If the graph is steeper then it is more inelastic and vice versa.</p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/Change in Demand and supply.png" width="461" height="157" /><figure/>
									<p>Another thing is the rise and fall of demand and supply curve. On the left, If a new technology is discovered for example and it makes producing things easier and faster, then suppliers would produce more quantity Q1, but since nothing has changed with the buyers, they'd have to decrease the prices to prevent an excess of stock, hence new equilibrium E1 .It would initially benefit buyers more, according to this model anyway. An increase in tax would have the opposite effect(consumers would pay more for less quantity) and the supply curve would shift to the left.</p>
									<p>On the right graph If there is an economic downturn or increase in demand for a rivalry product, the quantity demanded of a product would decline and suppliers would have to supply less which would lead to equilibrium E1. If the population increases or the economy improves however, the quantity demanded would rise and the demand curve would shift to the right .</p>

									<div id="Convergence and Equilibrium">
									<h2 class="convergence">Convergence and Equilibrium</h2>
									<h4>Convergence. </h4>
									<p>Convergence and equilibrium are 2 of my favourite things in mathematics. They are both cool concepts and they can be found anywhere, they're the backbone of our modern world, now without further adieu let's start off with convergence. What is convergence? Convergence is when things from different places are meeting at a point or place.</p>
									
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/convergence-300x193.jpg"/>(image source: https://www.agriinvestor.com/ag-starting-see-real-convergence/<figure/>
									<p>In mathematics you see this with sequences and functions as they approach a limit, a convergent function/sequence will just keep getting closer and closer to the convergent point as the domain values increase or decrease. This is a formal mathematical definition of convergence. </p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/SeqLimDef.png" width="356" height="206"/>(image source: Dr Eder Kikianty Analysis 220 Notes)<figure/>
									<p>Which is basically describing what is happening in this graph</p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/LimitSequenceGraph.png" width="336" height="239"/>(image source: Dr Eder Kikianty Analysis 220 Notes)<figure/>

									<p> One thing that makes mathematical convergence possible is limits in calculus, because they help us make use of the concept of infinity. Limits and convergence are the backbone of numerical analysis. Numerical analysis helps us solve problems that are unsolvable by conventional means, by using approximations that are so close to the answer they're practically the same as the answer. Numerical methods include the taylor series(which can approximate any function as a polynomial), the Riemann sum(for integrals), the finite difference method(for differential equations), Newton-rhapson method, euler method, Runge-kutta methods, Gradient descent and many others.</p>
									<p>Since these methods are algorithmic, they require a lot of iterations to get accurate results, but thanks to computers this is made easier, computers are particularly very good at equations like these if programmed correctly. Back in 1943-1946 the ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was developed, it was built to solve numerical problems(among other things )to help with the war and calculate ballistic firing tables quicker. The ENIAC could do 5000 calculations per second, smartphones nowadays can do more than 100 billion calculations per second.</p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/ENIAC.jpg" width="512" height="350"/><figure/>
									<h4>Convergence is useful to many branches of mathematics:</h4>
									<p>Like statistics and probability with central limit theorem and the law of large numbers which states that the larger the sample the more the results converge to the true value. It's also useful in computer science and machine learning with the gradient descent algorithm. In Economics there is a theory that states poor countries converge to richer countries. Developing countries have the potential to grow at a faster rate than developed countries because of diminishing marginal returns. Rich countries have already developed their science and technologies so poor countries can learn just from them right? Well…that’s not always the case for a variety of reasons, but we’re talking about convergence not economics!</p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/ConvergenceCountries.png" width="375" height="300"/>(image source:Introduction to Economic Growth, 3rd Edition.Norton & Company.)<figure/>

                                    <p>There's also convergence in animal evolution too,  where some animals have developed similar traits despite having no common ancestor with that specific trait. Eg. butterflies, birds and bats both have wings but no common ancestor with wings, maybe pigs will really fly someday, who knows.</p>
									<p>Then there is Media convergence, Media convergence is the process by which multiple media technologies are brought together into one computerised device</p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/Media-Convergence.jpg" width="448" height="317"/>(https://leverageedu.com/blog/media-convergence/)<figure/>
									<p>Then there's Convergence insufficiency which happens when the nerves that control your eye muscles don't work the right way. Which means our eyes converge when we look at things. </p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/convergence-insufficiency.png" width="" height=""/>(https://www.fultoneyecenter.com/what-is-convergence-insufficiency/)<figure/>
                                    <p>There is also convergence in research, where a development in one research field leads to a development in many other fields. As you can see, Convergence is everywhere!!! Are there any other convergence phenomena you have noticed in our world? Let me know if there is.</p>
									
									<h4>Equilibrium. </h4>
									<p>Equilibrium is when opposing forces or influences are balanced, if you did economics you might probably recognise the equilibrium as the point where demand and supply are equal, the definition makes sense for those too as you could say the forces of demand and supply are balanced on  that point. In physics it's when an object is at rest and isn't moving and has zero acceleration. There's an unstable and unstable kind of equilibrium. Stable forces imply the object in equilibrium will converge back to the equilibrium if it is displaced a little, like a spring when extended, and unstable forces imply that a little displacement induced will result in the divergence of the object. Like a ball on top of a hill if pushed.(that’ll be all for now #burnedOut)</p>
									<figure></figure><img src="./images/Stable-Unstable Equilibrium.png" width="302" height="320"/>([https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Stable-and-unstable-equilibria-In-a-stable-equilibrium-a-small-disturbance-caused-by_fig1_261758142)<figure/>
