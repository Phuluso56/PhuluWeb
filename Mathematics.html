                     <p>Mathematics is one of the most important fields of study in the world; it can be found everywhere from Physics, Finance, Biology, Geography, Architecture, Psychology, Music, Art, and literally any field you can think of.
                        Every great achievement in human life has some mathematics behind it.
                     </p>
                     <p>It is also found everywhere in nature, from the geometrical shapes of every living and non-living thing that all seem to follow consistent rules, to the symmetrical relationships of many natural objects, and the beautiful and pleasing patterns we hear in music. Whether we see it or not,
                        mathematics is everywhere. Mathematics is the one subject that seems to connect different fields that seem barely connected. I am a firm advocate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo's</a> quote of <b class="Yapping">“Mathematics is the language with which God has written the Universe!”.</b> As such, I believe the more we understand mathematics as people,
                        the more we begin to understand the world.

               <p>As we all know, mathematics is one of the most disliked subjects by people, mostly due to the way they were taught in schools and because many people believe they are not very good at it. But personally, I don’t think you need to be good with equations and all those other things to truly appreciate mathematics,
                  as it is a lot more than just numbers and equations. In this section, I try my best to show anyone reading this the beauty of mathematics, to gain a better appreciation of it. Please do not be intimidated by the equations, I tried my best to write them in a way that it still makes sense even if you ignore them.
               </p>
               <p class="Yapping">As of now, this is still a work in progress; mathematics has so much to offer, so I will add more things as time goes on. I hope you enjoy and maybe learn something. </p>

                        <h4><u>Weber -Fechner laws in psychometrics</u></h4>
                        <div class="row">

                              <p>If you are carrying 100 books and someone adds 1 book to your load, you probably wouldn't notice the difference vs if you were carrying just one book, right? That's what the <b>Weber-Fechner</b> laws tell us regarding stimulus as a whole. <b>The Weber law says in order for us to tell the difference, there has to be a 2% change in the stimulus</b>, for example if there's 10 spoons of sugar in a cup of tea, you have to add 0.2 of a spoon to feel any change, if there is 100 however, you have to add 2 spoons, if you add one you won't feel a difference according to the theory. It accounts for all other sensations as well: hearing, seeing, smelling, and touching.</p>
                              <p>Then there's the <b>Fechner method</b>, which says <b>there's a logarithmic relationship between the perceived strength and the stimulus strength</b>, hence the change in perceived stimulus declines the stronger a stimulus gets, since the derivative(\(dy\over dx\)) of \(y=log(x)\) is declining for positive values, kind of like <b>diminishing marginal utility</b>. Economists have also used these theories to study some consumer behaviour.</p>

                              <p>According to many psychologists, <b>the ability to retain what you just learned declines quickly at first, then levels off as time passes</b>. According to a <em>Wixted and Besen study of 1991,</em> it can be represented by an exponential model p= \(aex^{-bx}\), where <bdi style="color: black;">p is the probability</bdi> of a person being able to correctly recall an item learned. <bdi style="color: black;">\(x\) is the time</bdi> since learning it. <bdi style="color: black;"> And 0< a< 1 being the baseline retention</bdi> before time passed, b>0 is the rate of retention drops with time, if your b is lower, your probability of retention drops at a lower rate. So don't start studying the day before your exams, basically.</p>

                              <p>There's a formula for the <b>socially acceptable dating age difference</b> between men, and women and it is <b> \({Age\over 2}\)+7</b>. So if a person is 30, the youngest person they should date is \({30\over 2}\)+7=15+7=22. The formula is a y=mx+c type graph hence the acceptable age difference keeps rising the older the 2 people  are, as you can see from the graph.</p>
                              <p> Apparently, this formula has been around since the early <em>1900s</em>; however, it was not meant to be for the youngest age a person should date, like it's used today, but the <bdi style="color: black;">ideal age of a partner for a man</bdi>, which is interesting. Studies have shown it's fairly accurate, but only when the man is the older person. <em>According to a USA study from 2017, a huge majority of married couples in the US have an age gap of 1-3, and that is more common in many other countries too</em>.</p>

                        <p><em>50% of married American couples end in divorce</em>, and some researchers did a study on why this happens by putting couples together and letting them talk while they analysed their conversations, facial expressions, and many other factors and then made a mathematical model that predicts whether or not they’d end in divorce.</p>

                           </li>
                           <p>They computed for each conversation turn. Behaviour was considered positive if it correlated positively with marital happiness and negative otherwise. <bdi style="color: black;">The Rapid couples interaction scoring system (RCISS)</bdi> and the <bdi style="color: black;">Specific Affect Coding System(SPAFF)</bdi> was used to create numerical values of the behaviours. The sequence of scores were \(W_t\,H_t,W_{t+1},H_{t+1}\).\(H_t\)  is the husband variable at time t, and \(W_t\) is for the wife <em>(so it's: wife talks, husband responds,  wife responds, and so on.)</em></p>
                           <P>$$ W_{t+1}=a+r_1W_{t}+I_{HW}(H_t)...(1) $$

                           <p> <bdi style="color: black;"> \(a\), \(b\) and \(r\) are the parameters estimated from the data</bdi>. <bdi style="color: black;">\(r\) is the emotional inertia</bdi>, which is the tendency of the person to remain in the same state over a period of time. <bdi style="color: black;">\(a\) and \(b\) is the initial uninfluenced level of positivity minus negativity</bdi> each spouse brings to the interaction. The <bdi style="color: black;"> \(I_{HW}\) and \(I_{WH}\) are the influence functions</bdi>. Once the \(r_1\),\(r_2\), \(a\) and \(b\) are estimated from the data, (\(a\)+\(r_1W_t\)) and (\(b\)+\(r_2H_t\)) are then subtracted from equations (1) and (2) respectively, and the remainder will be the influence functions which were then plotted.</p>

                                 <p> Graphs <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> represent the influence the husbands have on their wives; what the husband does is the x-axis, and the wife's reaction is the y-axis. In graph <b>A</b>, the husband has no influence on her until he does or says something at <b>P</b> or <b>-P</b>, then he gets either a big positive or a big negative reaction . And in <b>B</b>, the husband in a different  couple, gets a little reaction for everything he does, either positive or negative,  so the growth is linear.  <em>Before we move on, in your opinion, what couple do you think would have a longer lasting marriage?</em></p>

                        <p>They used the term <b>“threshold of negativity”</b>, which  is the point at which negativity has an impact on the partners immediately following the behaviour. Apparently, a low threshold like in <b>B</b>, means couples end up happy and stable. It is the <b>"negativity detection effect"</b>, spouses responding to negative behaviour when it is less escalated.</p>
                        <p>With a couple of graph <b>A</b>, they accept negativity. Setting their threshold for a response at a higher level or more negative level, then blowing up when they've had enough, if the negativity threshold is really high, it means either the husband or wife has to become <bdi style="color: red;">very aggressive</bdi> to get a proper reaction from their spouse in an argument, which is a high risk factor for divorce, meanwhile couples in graph <b>B</b> who see a problem and immediately bring it up before it escalates too high usually have a longer lasting marriage, it was compared to how it's better to go to the hospital immediately when you notice a symptom and not when a disease gets worse. The bible verse <b>Ephesians 4:26</b> <em>‘’Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry’’</em>; was stated to support this. On the contrary, though some studies have suggested that couples can cultivate an empathetic response to their partner's negativity, but they didn't say anything about that leading to a longer lasting marriage.</p>

It uses <b>trilateration</b>, which is based on measuring distances using geometry and trigonometry. Satellites transmit radio signals containing the <bdi style="color: black;">time</bdi> the signal was sent and the <bdi style="color: black;">location</bdi> of the satellite, the signals are then received by GPS receivers  like our phones. Since the <b>electromagnetic waves</b> travel at the speed of light, they arrive after a certain time duration. We find the <bdi style="color: black;">distance</bdi> by multiplying the speed of light and the time it took the signal to arrive \(distance={speed\times{ (received\space time-sent\space time)}}\). Then <b>spherical geometry</b> and 2 other satellites is used to find the position of the GPS. </p>

So a 4th satellite and  some calculus are used to calculate the offset time. Satellites are placed in a way that we can access at least 4 from wherever we are, which is pretty cool. <b>Einstein's theory of relativity</b> also plays a factor since satellites orbit the earth at really fast speeds and experience less of the earth's gravity, which affects their atomic clocks.  These conditions are, however, integrated to the computers that do these calculations, thus accounting for the rates of the atomic clocks. If this wasn't done, there'd be an added <bdi style="color: red;">error of 10km</bdi> every day, which is crazy to think about.

                        <p>the <b>median voter theorem</b> states that <b>political parties that cater to the median or average person in a group of people are more likely to win</b>, because if for example a party tries to cater too much to the rich people they might lose voters from the poorer group and if they cater to the poor they'll  lose votes from the rich, but if they cater to the middle persons though they'll  get  votes from middle people,  some votes from rich people and some from the poor who are willing to compromise vs a party that only caters to and gets votes from one side. It's not just rich and poor that play a factor to who the middle person is, but also a wider range of ideologies and/or policies. I learnt about this little theory in second year economics, and it also applies to businesses too, sometimes even movies. The model has some obvious flaws, which I won't delve into, but you can go and learn more about it if you're interested. </p>

                        <h4>The golden ratio </h4>
                        <p>The <b>golden ratio</b>, also known as the divine proportion, in simple terms, is a ratio between 2 numbers which is an irrational number approximately equal to 1.618, denoted by \(\phi\).  But where does the number 1.618 come from? </p>
                        <figure>
                           <img src="./Files/Misc/Golden ratio-1.png" style="width:50%" /> 
                        </figure>
                        <p>Suppose we have a rectangle with dimensions \((a+b)\times a\), then we draw another rectangle of the same proportion and same length as the previous rectangle inside said rectangle, then we have another rectangle of dimensions  \(a\times a\) We can keep repeating the process to infinity, but for now let’s focus on the first 2 rectangles. The ratios of the 2 rectangles will be:
                           $${{a+b}\over a}={{a}\over b}=\phi$$
                           $$1+{{a}\over b}=1+{{1}\over \phi}$$
                           $$1+{{1}\over \phi}=\phi$$
                           $$\therefore \phi^2-\phi-1=0$$
                           and using the quadratic equation we get: \(\phi\)=\({1+\sqrt{5} }\over 2\)=\(1.6180339887...\)
                        </p>
                        <h4>Relationship between the Fibonacci and the Golden ratio.</h4>
                        <p>Before we get into the relationship between the Fibonacci sequence and the Golden ratio, let's talk about the Fibonacci sequence. What is the Fibonacci sequence? </p>
                        <p>The Fibonacci sequence is a recursive sequence where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers in the series. For example, look at the first 10 terms of the sequence: $$ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34... $$
                           Notice how 8=5+3(the 2 numbers before 8),13=8+5(the 2 numbers before13) and so on. This can be mathematically recursively defined as:
                           $$ F_0=0\\ F_1=1\\ F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}\ (where\ n\ \in\mathbb{N} ,n\geq2)$$
                           and also, non-recursively defined as
                           $$F(n) = { 1\over {\sqrt5}}\Biggr[({1+\sqrt{5} \over 2})^n-({1-\sqrt{5} \over 2})^n\Biggr](where\ n\ \in\mathbb{N})$$
                           The second formula is obtained by applying the first formula in conjunction with the power series and performing some algebraic manipulations, which I will not elaborate on here. Back to the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci shown above, notice how \(13 \over8\)=1.625, \(21 \over13\)=1.615, and \(34 \over21\)=1.619? The ratios between the 2 consecutive numbers of the Fibonacci sequence converge to the golden ratio \(\phi\) the bigger the Fibonacci sequence grows in mathematical terms:  $$ \lim_{n \to \infty}{F_{n}\over F_{n-1}}= { {1+\sqrt{5} }\over 2}=1.6180339887...$$
                        </p>
                        <h4>The golden ratio and beauty:</h4>
                        <p>The golden ratio has been observed to appear in numerous places in nature and is considered visually pleasing by many. As a result, artists over the years have sought to incorporate this beauty by applying the golden ratio in their artworks.</p>

                              <p>Convergence and equilibrium are 2 of my favourite concepts in mathematics; they are both cool concepts which can be found anywhere and are the backbone of our modern world, now, without further adieu let's start off with convergence.

                        <p>In mathematics, you see this with sequences and functions as they approach a limit; a convergent function/sequence will just keep getting closer and closer to the convergent point as the domain values increase or decrease. This is a formal mathematical definition of convergence: </p>
                        <P><b>A sequence \(a_{n}\) converges to limit \(L\) if and only if for every \( \varepsilon  > 0 \) there exists a natural number  \(N\) such that  \(\forall_{n\epsilon N}\) :$$n >N  \Longrightarrow \ |a_n-L|<\epsilon$$</b> this is denoted by \(lim_{n \rightarrow \infty }a_n=L\).\(a_{n}\) tends to \(L\) as  \(n\) tends to infinity, which is basically describing what is happening in the following graph</P>

                        <img src="./Files/Graphs/Graph03-Sequence.png" style="width:55%"/>
                        <p> One thing that makes mathematical convergence possible is limits in calculus, because they help us make use of the concept of infinity. Limits and convergence are the backbone of <b>numerical analysis.</b> Numerical analysis helps us solve problems that are unsolvable by conventional means, by using approximations that are so close to the answer they're practically the same as the answer. Numerical methods include the <b>Gauss elimination</b> method, the <b>Taylor series</b> <em>(which can approximate any function as a polynomial)</em>, the <b>Riemann sum</b><em>(for integrals)</em>, the <b>Finite difference method</b> <em>(for differential equations)</em>, the <b>Newton-Rhapson method</b>, the <b>Euler method</b>, <b>Runge-kutta</b> methods, the <b>Gradient descent</b>, and many others.

                              <p>Since these methods are algorithmic, they require a lot of iterations to get accurate results, but thanks to computers, this is made easier, computers are particularly very good at equations like these if programmed correctly. Back in <em>1943-1946</em>, the <b style="color: gainsboro;">ENIAC</b><em>(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)</em> was developed.

                              <p>Convergence is useful in many branches of mathematics,Like statistics and probability, with the <b>Central limit theorem</b> and the <b>law of large numbers</b>, which states that the larger the sample, the more the results converge to the true value. It's also useful in computer science and machine learning with the <b>gradient descent</b> algorithm. In Economics there is a theory that states that <b>poor countries converge to richer countries</b>. Developing countries have the potential to grow at a faster rate than developed countries because of <b>diminishing marginal returns</b>. Rich countries have already developed their science and technologies, so poor countries can learn just from them, right? <em>Well…that’s not always the case for a variety of reasons, but we’re talking about convergence, not economics!

                        <p>There's a lot more convergence phenomena in our world, like <b>convergence in animal evolution</b>,  where some animals have developed similar traits despite having no common ancestor with that specific trait. E.g., butterflies, birds, and bats both have wings but no common ancestor with wings, <em>maybe pigs will really fly someday, who knows.</em> There is also <b>Media convergence</b>, which is the process by which multiple media technologies are brought together into one computerised device. </p>

                           Statistics has been the backbone of decision-making throughout history, not
                           only by governments, research facilities, and big corporations, but also by
                           us as individuals.  Before you buy a product, things like the ratings of the
                           product on the internet and phrases like "Recommended by 99% of experts” can
                           sway your decision to buy the product. Before you choose which university to
                           go to, statistics like “100% of people who graduate from this institution
                           are employed,” and “there is a 60% chance of finishing this degree”, also
                           influence your decision. But in many cases, phrases like these are usually
                           misleading at best and outright false at worst, as such, it is very crucial
                           to understand the statistical fallacies we as people are prone to fall for.
                           Interpreting data and statistics accurately is the first step towards making
                           informed decisions. In this section, we will discuss 10 statistical
                           fallacies people are prone to fall for.

                        <p>
                           Correlation shows how strongly related 2 variables are; in statistics, it is
                           expressed numerically by the correlation coefficient. A positive correlation
                           means that 2 variables increase and decrease at the same time, and a
                           negative correlation means that when one variable is increasing, the other
                           is decreasing and vice versa. However, just because 2 events are correlated,
                           doesn’t mean one caused the other. [correlation picture x 2]

                           people buy ice cream, and more people go to the beach when it’s hot.

                           Suppose you have 10 blue balls and 5 red balls in a bag, without looking
                           inside the bag, what is the probability of reaching inside and taking out a
                           red ball? it’s \(5\over 15\) =33.33% because there are 5 red balls and a
                           total of 15 balls. Now suppose you do take out the red ball, and now there
                           are 4 red balls. Now what is the probability of taking out the red ball
                           again?  \(5\over 15\)=26.66%, there is now a lower probability compared to
                           the first attempt. This is because the first and second events of taking the
                           ball out of the bag are dependent on each other; in probability, these are
                           called <strong>dependent events</strong>.

                           again after getting heads, what is the probability of getting heads again?

                           Regression toward the mean is a statistical phenomenon that, if one variable
                           is very high or very low on the first measurement, then it will tend toward
                           the mean on its second measurement. Regression toward the mean is possible
                           due to randomness. When you get an outlier when measuring a variable, it is
                           often because other one time random events were also at play, events that
                           will not be at play when you measure the variable again. Hence, it will
                           return closer to the mean. [insert pic]

                           Look at the graph above. The total application acceptance of men is 43%,
                           which is higher than the respective 35% for women. However, if we break
                           things down by each course, you'll find that women scored higher than men in
                           each subject, 80% and 27% vs 62% and 26% for Courses 1 and 2 respectively.
                           This is what is known as the Simpson's paradox, the skew is caused by the
                           fact that women had applied to highly competitive departments in high
                           numbers with high acceptance rates for everyone. This is based on the UC
                           Berkeley Gender Bias (1973) where the university was accused of gender bias
                           until the data was broken down by departments.

                           the pandemic, Italy had more deaths due to covid than China. But when the
                           data was broken down by age it was found that China had higher covid death
                           rates than italy in every age group. But because Italy had much older
                           population…

                           because it lost a rich person, and the poor country’s average will also go
                           up, because gained a rich person.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Every statistical test or experiment is likely going to contain some error
                           or unexpected finding because nothing is perfect, as such the more you make
                           conduct tests the more errors you’re likely going to run into. The multiple
                           comparisons fallacy occurs when researchers take such errors to be
                           significant findings even though they appeared by chance and are very few
                           compared to the rest of the findings
