                     <p>Mathematics is one of the most important fields of study in the world; it can be found everywhere from Physics, Finance, Biology, Geography, Architecture, Psychology, Music, Art, and literally any field you can think of.
                        Every great achievement in human life has some mathematics behind it.
                     </p>
                     <p>It is also found everywhere in nature, from the geometrical shapes of every living and non-living thing that all seem to follow consistent rules, to the symmetrical relationships of many natural objects, and the beautiful and pleasing patterns we hear in music. Whether we see it or not,
                        mathematics is everywhere. Mathematics is the one subject that seems to connect different fields that seem barely connected. I am a firm advocate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo's</a> quote of <b class="Yapping">“Mathematics is the language with which God has written the Universe!”.</b> As such, I believe the more we understand mathematics as people,
                        the more we begin to understand the world.

               <p>As we all know, mathematics is one of the most disliked subjects by people, mostly due to the way they were taught in schools and because many people believe they are not very good at it. But personally, I don’t think you need to be good with equations and all those other things to truly appreciate mathematics,
                  as it is a lot more than just numbers and equations. In this section, I try my best to show anyone reading this the beauty of mathematics, to gain a better appreciation of it. Please do not be intimidated by the equations, I tried my best to write them in a way that it still makes sense even if you ignore them.
               </p>
               <p class="Yapping">As of now, this is still a work in progress; mathematics has so much to offer, so I will add more things as time goes on. I hope you enjoy and maybe learn something. </p>

                              <p>If you are carrying 100 books and someone adds 1 book to your load, you probably wouldn't notice the difference vs if you were carrying just one book, right? That's what the <b>Weber-Fechner</b> laws tell us regarding stimulus as a whole. <b>The Weber law says in order for us to tell the difference, there has to be a 2% change in the stimulus</b>, for example if there's 10 spoons of sugar in a cup of tea, you have to add 0.2 of a spoon to feel any change, if there is 100 however, you have to add 2 spoons, if you add one you won't feel a difference according to the theory. It accounts for all other sensations as well: hearing, seeing, smelling, and touching. </p>
                              <p>Then there's the <b>Fechner method</b>, which says <b>there's a logarithmic relationship between the perceived strength and the stimulus strength</b>, hence the change in perceived stimulus declines the stronger a stimulus gets, since the derivative(\(dy\over dx\)) of \(y=log(x)\) is declining for positive values, kind of like <b>diminishing marginal utility</b>. Economists have also used these theories to study some consumer behaviour. </p>

                              <p>According to many psychologists, <b>the ability to retain what you just learned declines quickly at first, then levels off as time passes</b>. According to a <em>Wixted and Besen study of 1991, </em> it can be represented by an exponential model p= \(aex^{-bx}\), where <bdi style="color: black;">p is the probability</bdi> of a person being able to correctly recall an item learned. <bdi style="color: black;">\(x\) is the time</bdi> since learning it. <bdi style="color: black;"> And 0< a< 1 being the baseline retention</bdi> before time passed, b>0 is the rate of retention drops with time, if your b is lower, your probability of retention drops at a lower rate.

                              <p>There's a formula for the <b>socially acceptable dating age difference</b> between men, and women and it is <b> \({Age\over 2}\)+7</b>. So, if a person is 30, the youngest person they should date is \({30\over 2}\)+7=15+7=22. The formula is a y=mx+c type graph hence the acceptable age difference keeps rising the older the 2 people are, as you can see from the graph. </p>
                              <p> Apparently, this formula has been around since the early <em>1900s</em>; however, it was not meant to be for the youngest age a person should date, like it's used today, but the <bdi style="color: black;">ideal age of a partner for a man</bdi>, which is interesting. Studies have shown it's fairly accurate, but only when the man is the older person. <em>According to a USA study from 2017, a huge majority of married couples in the US have an age gap of 1-3, and that is more common in many other countries too</em>. </p>

                        <p><em>50% of married American couples end in divorce</em>, and some researchers did a study on why this happens by putting couples together and letting them talk while they analysed their conversations, facial expressions, and many other factors and then made a mathematical model that predicts whether or not they’d end in divorce.</p>

                           </li>
                           <p>They computed for each conversation turn. Behaviour was considered positive if it correlated positively with marital happiness and negative otherwise. <bdi style="color: black;">The Rapid couples interaction scoring system (RCISS)</bdi> and the <bdi style="color: black;">Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF)</bdi> was used to create numerical values of the behaviours. The sequence of scores were \(W_t\,H_t,W_{t+1},H_{t+1}\).\(H_t\)  is the husband variable at time t, and \(W_t\) is for the wife <em>(so it's: wife talks, husband responds,  wife responds, and so on.)</em></p>

The <bdi style="color: black;"> \(I_{HW}\) and \(I_{WH}\) are the influence functions</bdi>. Once the \(r_1\),\(r_2\), \(a\) and \(b\) are estimated from the data, (\(a\)+\(r_1W_t\)) and (\(b\)+\(r_2H_t\)) are then subtracted from equations (1) and (2) respectively, and the remainder will be the influence functions which were then plotted.</p>

                                 <p> Graphs <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> represent the influence the husbands have on their wives; what the husband does is the x-axis, and the wife's reaction is the y-axis. In graph <b>A</b>, the husband has no influence on her until he does or says something at <b>P</b> or <b>-P</b>, then he gets either a big positive or a big negative reaction. And in <b>B</b>, the husband in a different couple, gets a little reaction for everything he does, either positive or negative, so the growth is linear.  <em>Before we move on, in your opinion, what couple do you think would have a longer lasting marriage? </em></p>

                        <p>They used the term <b> “threshold of negativity” </b>, which is the point at which negativity has an impact on the partners immediately following the behaviour. Apparently, a low threshold like in <b>B</b>, means couples end up happy and stable. It is the <b>"negativity detection effect"</b>, spouses responding to negative behaviour when it is less escalated. </p>
                        <p>With a couple of graph <b>A</b>, they accept negativity. Setting their threshold for a response at a higher level or more negative level, then blowing up when they've had enough, if the negativity threshold is really high, it means either the husband or wife has to become <bdi style="color: red;">very aggressive</bdi> to get a proper reaction from their spouse in an argument, which is a high risk factor for divorce, meanwhile couples in graph <b>B</b> who see a problem and immediately bring it up before it escalates too high usually have a longer lasting marriage, it was compared to how it's better to go to the hospital immediately when you notice a symptom and not when a disease gets worse. The bible verse <b>Ephesians 4:26</b> <em> ‘’Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry’’</em>; was stated to support this. On the contrary, though some studies have suggested that couples can cultivate an empathetic response to their partner's negativity, but they didn't say anything about that leading to a longer lasting marriage. </p>

It uses <b>trilateration</b>, which is based on measuring distances using geometry and trigonometry. Satellites transmit radio signals containing the <bdi style="color: black;">time</bdi> the signal was sent and the <bdi style="color: black;">location</bdi> of the satellite, the signals are then received by GPS receivers like our phones. Since the <b>electromagnetic waves</b> travel at the speed of light, they arrive after a certain time duration. We find the <bdi style="color: black;">distance</bdi> by multiplying the speed of light and the time it took the signal to arrive \(distance={speed\times{ (received\space time-sent\space time)}}\). Then <b>spherical geometry</b> and 2 other satellites are used to find the position of the GPS. </p>

Satellites are placed in a way that we can access at least 4 from wherever we are, which is pretty cool. <b>Einstein's theory of relativity</b> also plays a factor since satellites orbit the earth at really fast speeds and experience less of the earth's gravity, which affects their atomic clocks.  These conditions are, however, integrated to the computers that do these calculations, thus accounting for the rates of the atomic clocks. If this wasn't done, there'd be an added <bdi style="color: red;">error of 10km</bdi> every day, which is crazy to think about.

                        <p>the <b>median voter theorem</b> states that <b>political parties that cater to the median or average person in a group of people are more likely to win</b>, because if for example a party tries to cater too much to the rich people they might lose voters from the poorer group and if they cater to the poor they'll  lose votes from the rich, but if they cater to the middle persons though they'll  get  votes from middle people,  some votes from rich people and some from the poor who are willing to compromise vs a party that only caters to and gets votes from one side. It's not just rich and poor that play a factor in who the middle person is, but also a wider range of ideologies and/or policies. I learnt about this little theory in second year economics, and it also applies to businesses too, sometimes even movies. The model has some obvious flaws, which I won't delve into, but you can go and learn more about it if you're interested. </p>

                        <h4>The golden ratio </h4>
                        <p>The <b>golden ratio</b>, also known as the divine proportion, in simple terms, is a ratio between 2 numbers which is an irrational number approximately equal to 1.618, denoted by \(\phi\).  But where does the number 1.618 come from? </p>
                        <figure>
                           <img src="./Files/Misc/Golden ratio-1.png" style="width:50%" /> 
                        </figure>
                        <p>Suppose we have a rectangle with dimensions \((a+b)\times a\), then we draw another rectangle of the same proportion and same length as the previous rectangle inside said rectangle, then we have another rectangle of dimensions  \(a\times a\), We can keep repeating the process to infinity, but for now let’s focus on the first 2 rectangles. The ratios of the 2 rectangles will be:
                           $${{a+b}\over a}={{a}\over b}=\phi$$
                           $$1+{{a}\over b}=1+{{1}\over \phi}$$
                           $$1+{{1}\over \phi}=\phi$$
                           $$\therefore \phi^2-\phi-1=0$$
                           and using the quadratic equation we get: \(\phi\)=\({1+\sqrt{5} }\over 2\)=\(1.6180339887...\)
                        </p>
                        <h4><u>Relationship between the Fibonacci and the Golden ratio. </u></h4>
                        <p>Before we get into the relationship between the Fibonacci sequence and the Golden ratio, let's talk about the Fibonacci sequence. What is the Fibonacci sequence? </p>
                        <p>The <b>Fibonacci sequence</b> is a recursive sequence where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers in the series. For example, look at the first 10 terms of the sequence: $$ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34... $$
                           Notice how 8=5+3(the 2 numbers before 8),13=8+5(the 2 numbers before13) and so on. This can be mathematically recursively defined as:
                           $$ F_0=0\\ F_1=1\\ F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}\ (where\ n\ \in\mathbb{N} ,n\geq2)$$
                           and also, non-recursively defined as
                           $$F(n) = { 1\over {\sqrt5}}\Biggr[({1+\sqrt{5} \over 2})^n-({1-\sqrt{5} \over 2})^n\Biggr](where\ n\ \in\mathbb{N})$$
                           The second formula is obtained by applying the first formula in conjunction with the power series and performing some algebraic manipulations, which I will not elaborate on here. Back to the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci shown above, notice how \(13 \over8\)=1.625, \(21 \over13\)=1.615, and \(34 \over21\)=1.619? The ratios between the 2 consecutive numbers of the Fibonacci sequence converge to the golden ratio \(\phi\) the bigger the Fibonacci sequence grows in mathematical terms:  $$ \lim_{n \to \infty}{F_{n}\over F_{n-1}}= { {1+\sqrt{5} }\over 2}=1.6180339887...$$
                        </p>
                        <h4><u>The golden ratio and beauty:</u></h4>
                        <p>The golden ratio has been observed to appear in numerous places in nature and is considered visually pleasing by many. As a result, artists over the years have sought to incorporate this beauty by applying the golden ratio in their artworks. </p>

                              <p>Convergence and equilibrium are 2 of my favourite concepts in mathematics; they are both cool concepts which can be found anywhere and are the backbone of our modern world. Now, without further ado, let's start off with convergence. What is convergence? <b style="color: tomato;">Convergence is when things from different places meet at a point or place</b>.</p>
                           </div>

                        <p>In mathematics, you see this with sequences and functions as they approach a limit; a convergent function/sequence will just keep getting closer and closer to the convergent point as the domain values increase or decrease. This is a formal mathematical definition of convergence: </p>
                        <P><b>A sequence \(a_{n}\) converges to limit \(L\) if and only if for every \( \varepsilon  > 0 \) there exists a natural number  \(N\) such that  \(\forall_{n\epsilon N}\) :$$n >N  \Longrightarrow \ |a_n-L|<\epsilon$$</b> this is denoted by \(lim_{n \rightarrow \infty }a_n=L\).\(a_{n}\) tends to \(L\) as  \(n\) tends to infinity, which basically describes what is happening in the following graph</P>

                        <img src="./Files/Graphs/Graph03-Sequence.png" style="width:55%"/>
                        <p> One thing that makes mathematical convergence possible is limits in calculus, because they help us make use of the concept of infinity. Limits and convergence are the backbone of <b>numerical analysis. </b> Numerical analysis helps us solve problems that are unsolvable by conventional means, by using approximations that are so close to the answer they're practically the same as the answer. Numerical methods include the <b>Gauss elimination</b> method, the <b>Taylor series</b> <em>(which can approximate any function as a polynomial)</em>, the <b>Riemann sum</b><em>(for integrals)</em>, the <b>Finite difference method</b> <em>(for differential equations)</em>, the <b>Newton-Raphson method</b>, the <b>Euler method</b>, <b>Runge-Kutta</b> methods, the <b>Gradient descent</b>, and many others.

                              <p>Since these methods are algorithmic, they require a lot of iterations to get accurate results, but thanks to computers, this is made easier. Computers are particularly very good at equations like these if programmed correctly. Back in <em>1943-1946</em>, the <b style="color: gainsboro;">ENIAC</b><em>(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)</em> was developed. It was built to solve numerical problems<em>(among other things )</em> to help with the war and calculate ballistic firing tables quickly.

                              <p>Convergence is useful in many branches of mathematics, like statistics and probability, with the <b>Central limit theorem</b> and the <b>law of large numbers</b>, which states that the larger the sample, the more the results converge to the true value. It's also useful in computer science and machine learning with the <b>gradient descent</b> algorithm. In Economics there is a theory that states that <b>poor countries converge to richer countries</b>. Developing countries have the potential to grow at a faster rate than developed countries because of <b>diminishing marginal returns</b>. Rich countries have already developed their science and technologies, so poor countries can learn just from them, right? <em>Well…that’s not always the case for a variety of reasons, but we’re talking about convergence, not economics!

                        <p>There's a lot more convergence phenomena in our world, like <b>convergence in animal evolution</b>, where some animals have developed similar traits despite having no common ancestor with that specific trait. E.g., butterflies, birds, and bats both have wings but no common ancestor with wings, <em>maybe pigs will really fly someday, who knows. </em> There is also <b>Media convergence</b>, which is the process by which multiple media technologies are brought together into one computerised device. </p>

In physics, it's when an object is at rest, isn't moving, and has zero acceleration. There's <b>stable</b> and <b>unstable equilibrium</b>. Stable equilibrium implies <b>the object in equilibrium will converge back to the equilibrium if it is displaced a little</b>, like a spring when extended, and unstable equilibrium implies that <b>a little displacement induced will result in the divergence of the object</b>, like a ball on top of a hill if pushed.<em>(www.researchgate.net/figure/Stable-and-unstable-equilibria-In-a-stable-equilibrium-a-small-disturbance-caused-by_fig1_261758142)</em></p>

                           Statistics has been the backbone of decision-making throughout history, not used
                           only by governments, research facilities, and big corporations, but also by
                           us as individuals.  Before you buy a product, statistics like the rating of the
                           product on the internet and phrases like <em>"Recommended by 90% of experts” </em> can
                           sway your decision to buy the product. Before you choose which university to
                           go to, statistics like <em> “100% of people who graduate from this institution
                           are employed” </em>, and <em> “there is only a 50% chance of completing this degree in record time” </em>, can also
                           influence your decision. But in many cases, phrases like these, when looked at face value, can be
                           misleading at best and outright false at worst. As such, it is very crucial
                           to understand the statistical traps, we as people are prone to fall for.
                           Interpreting data and statistics accurately is the first step towards making
                           informed decisions. In this section, we will discuss 12 of those statistical
                           traps.

                        <p>
                           <b> Correlation</b> shows how strongly related 2 values are; in statistics, it is
                           expressed numerically by the <b>correlation coefficient(r)</b>. A positive correlation
                           means that 2 values increase and decrease at the same time, and a
                           negative correlation means that when one variable is increasing, the other
                           is decreasing and vice versa. However, just because 2 events are correlated,
                           doesn’t mean one caused the other.

But ice cream isn't the cause of sharks attacking people, or vice versa; a more rational conclusion would be that it’s because more people buy ice cream, and more people go to the beach when it’s hot.

                           <strong>
                           Sampling</strong>is the process of selecting a smaller group as a representation
                           of a larger group
                           . This makes gathering data and making inferences about an entire group a
                           lot simpler.
                           <strong>
                           Sampling bias</strong>, on the other hand, occurs when certain members of the
                           group are more likely to be selected than others
                           . This often leads to false inferences about the larger group due to the
                           data being unfairly skewed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           What leads to sampling bias is when researchers use their
                           judgment to select participants, when researchers select individuals or
                           elements that are easiest to access or reach, flawed random selection
                           methods, and when people with specific characteristics are more likely to
                           agree to take part in a study than others.

                                    Though One Piece is indeed the greatest, this is a form of sampling bias
                                    because the page is followed by mostly One Piece fans.

                                 trying to figure out the locations to reinforce bomber planes for better
                                 protection, the first idea was to reinforce it based on the locations that
                                 the returning planes suffered the most damage, Abraham Wald, a famous
                                 statistician, noted that the most severely damaged planes were actually the
                                 ones that did not return. And that the locations on the returned planes were
                                 spots in which aircraft could sustain many bullet holes and still return,
                                 while the planes that sustained enemy fire in other locations were the ones
                                 that went down

                        <p>
                           <b>Regression toward the mean</b> is a statistical phenomenon that, if one variable
                           is very high or very low on the first measurement, then it will tend toward
                           the mean on its second measurement. Regression toward the mean is possible
                           due to randomness. When you get an outlier when measuring a variable, it is
                           often because other one-time random events were also at play, events that
                           will not be at play when you measure the variable again. Hence, it will
                           return closer to the mean.

                           each course, 80% and 27% vs 62% and 26% for Courses 1 and 2 respectively.
                           This is what is known as the <b>Simpson's paradox</b>, the skew is caused by the
                           fact that more women applied a highly competitive course with
                           with low acceptance rates for everyone. This is based on the UC
                           Berkeley Gender Bias controversy (1973) where the university was accused of gender bias
                           until the data was broken down by departments.

                           measure success during the Vietnam War (1955-1975), ignoring crucial

                           inside the bag, what is the probability of reaching inside and taking out a
                           red ball? it’s \(5\over 15\) =33.33% because there are <b style="color: red;">5 red balls</b> and a
                           total of 15 balls. Now suppose you do take out the <b style="color: red;">red ball</b>, and now there
                           are <b style="color: red;">4 red balls</b>. Now, what is the probability of taking out the red ball
                           again?  \(5\over 15\)=26.66%, there is now a lower probability compared to
                           the first attempt. This is because the first and second events of taking the
                           ball out of the bag are dependent on each other; in probability, these are

                           still \(1 \over2\)=50%. This is because these 2 events are
