                                <p>The highest rises in the rate of unemployment are in 2009 and 2021, which can be linked to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and the 2020-2022 Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

                                 qualifications from other tertiaries are always lower than the national unemployment rate, while those with no matric or only matric are always above.</p>

                    <p>When you're arguing or debating any topic, whether it's politics, sports, anime/series, artists, etc., you need facts, evidence and stats in order to prevail. Stats are essentially more powerful than the former simply because they often encapsulate the other two, plus the fact that in some cases it honestly doesn't even matter if the stats being presented are true or not, or whether they come from a credible source, bottom line is if you have stats of any kind, whatever point you're arguing will hold more weight to it vs when you don't. In this part of the section, I am going to pitch why <strong>One Piece</strong> is a really impressive piece of media, without focusing too much on the story or my anecdotal experience with it, but the stats instead.</p>
                    <div class="row">

                            <p>But first off, what is One Piece? apart from being my favorite show of all time, One Piece is originally a Japanese manga&nbsp;<em>(graphic novel or comic)</em> series written and illustrated by <strong>Eiichiro Oda</strong> or as we fans like to call him <strong>&quot;Goda&quot;</strong>, it has been serialized in Shueisha 's shōnen manga magazine <strong>Weekly Shōnen Jump</strong> since July 1997, as of October 2024 it currently has a total of 109 volumes with a combination of 1128 chapters. One Piece also has an anime adaptation with 1122 episodes which is how most people experience the story. It is one of the longest series ever, but unlike most shows of its length there's a very good reason it is long, not limited to the vast world building, hundreds of amazing characters and the vast mysteries, so much that there are people on YouTube who have made a career out of talking about One Piece alone. I've personally been following the story closely since 2014, anyone who knows me well enough knows just how much this story means to me.</p>

                            <p>One Piece sales volume sales spiked during 2010 and 2011, this was mostly because of the promotion and release of the first big One Piece movie, <strong>Strong world(2010)</strong>, this was also around time the <strong>Marineford</strong> arc was airing in the anime, which is considered by many to be the greatest arc in the story and one of the greatest, if not the greatest arc in all of anime, this is when One Piece was at its prime, and there was no better time to become a fan.</p>

                            <p>One Piece is the highest selling manga of all time with an approximate of 535 million copies sold. For reference <strong>Dragon ball Z</strong> another titan of a manga franchise, is sitting at no. 5 with 260 million copies sold, and <strong>Naruto</strong> at no. 6 with 250 million, these aren't low numbers by any means, One Piece just gaps all its competition when it comes to manga sales.</p>
                            <p>In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the <strong>Guinness World Record</strong> for <em>&quot;the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author&quot;.</em></p>

                            <p>Eiichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece is the no. 10th highest selling author of all time in terms of most copies sold, for reference no.1 is <strong>Shakespeare</strong>, <strong>Daniel steel</strong> is no. 4 and <strong>J. K. Rowling</strong>, the author of <strong>Harry Potter</strong> is no. 8. This is particularly an amazing feat to me because Manga is still a relatively niche medium in the general public compared novels.</p>

                            <p>One Piece is not only the highest selling because of its length, it has been the best-selling manga for 18 years out of the 26 years it has been serialized. It was the best-selling manga every year&nbsp; (copies sold per year) for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, the streak was eventually broken by <strong>Demon slayer</strong> in 2019, I remember being devastated back in 2019 when the news broke out, I was looking for every source wishing it wasn't true.</p>

                            <p>The amount of One Piece chapters we get a year has been declined gradually which is to be expected, considering the author has been writing and illustrating it for 26+ years, if anything One Piece fans are generally happy when we see the author taking priority of his health and not overworking himself.</p>
                            <p>2020 and 2023 are the lowest of all, 2020 because of the covid-19 pandemic and 2023 because the author was busy working with the Live action adaptation of One Piece.</p>

                            <p>These are the numbers of visits to the One Piece page on Wikipedia, on August 2023 there was a massive spike, this without a doubt due to the release of the One Piece Live Action adaptation which was a huge success and the first successful live action anime adaptation, it was one of the most successful &amp; highly rated shows on Netflix in 2023 <em>(One Piece stays winning)</em>.</p>
                            <p>The live action adaptation got many new people into the show and raised the overall interest in the One Piece franchise. It was honestly a great time to be a One Piece fan, I even had some family members discussing it with me which was something I thought would never happen. Right now, I'm just hoping season 2 will be just as good.</p>

                    <p>The story of One Piece is divided into sagas, each saga focuses on its own different themes, conflicts, characters and locations, it is an adventure story after all. You could think of a saga as like a season, but since One Piece is a weekly manga, we can't really use the season metric. Each saga also has its own arcs which are essentially the storylines within each saga.</p><canvas id="ArchapterLength" style="width:50%;"><br></canvas>
                    <p>The Wano arc is the longest arc in the story, it stared in July 2018, when I was in matric, I remember being very excited when it began, because I had been anticipating it since 2016, It ended in August 2022; I had a beard by the time it ended which I find funny. Most people complain about how long recent arcs have become compared to the earlier arcs, a sentiment I can relate to however, I understand it's because the One Piece story and world is of a grater magnitude now, there are more characters, more mysteries and bigger conflicts that it would be impossible for everything to be resolved in a few chapters without making some bad writing choices.</p><!-- Graph seven --><canvas id="OPSagas" style="width:100%;"><br></canvas><!-- Graph eight --><canvas id="ArcEpisodeLength" style="width:50%;"><br></canvas>
                    <p>The One Piece anime has a separate pacing problem of its own , usually an anime is shorter when you compare it to the number of chapters of the adapted manga, for example: <strong>HunterXHunter(2011)</strong> has <bdi style="color: forestgreen;">148 episodes</bdi> adapting <bdi style="color: royalblue;">339 chapters</bdi>, <strong>Death Note</strong> has <bdi style="color: forestgreen;">37 episodes</bdi> adapting <bdi style="color: royalblue;">108 chapters</bdi>, Naruto has about <bdi style="color: forestgreen;">427 cannon episodes</bdi> adapting <bdi style="color: royalblue;">700 chapters</bdi> and so on...; the Wano arc in the anime however, has <bdi style="color: red;">191 episodes</bdi> adapting <bdi style="color: royalblue;">149 chapters</bdi>, Whole cake arc is <bdi style="color: red;">95</bdi> adapting <bdi style="color: royalblue;">78 chapters</bdi>, and Dressrosa is <bdi style="color: red;">118</bdi> adapting <bdi style="color: royalblue;">102</bdi> and so on. The point I'm trying to make being that the anime, especially with the recent arcs, doesn't promote the One Piece franchise as well as it should, there should be way fewer episodes and way better animation to attract new fans, but instead they stretch out <em>(no pun intended)</em> an already long series. Luckily there's a new anime adaptation in the works by Netflix/Wit Studio which will do the story justice, plus remastered versions of the current anime that are in the works as of 13 October 2024. But despite everything I have said, I still love the current One Piece anime adaptation and I think it's a good way to experience the story in many ways, I just have higher standards when it comes to One Piece.</p>
