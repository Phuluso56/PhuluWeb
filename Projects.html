								 <h1>One Piece Stats</h1>
								 <p>When you&apos;re arguing or debating any topic, weather it&apos;s politics, sports, anime/series, artists, etc., you need facts, evidence and stats in order to prevail. Stats are essentially more powerful than the former simply because they often encapsulate the other two , plus the fact that in some cases it honestly doesn&apos;t even matter if the stats being presented are true or not, or weather they come from a credible source, bottom line is if you have stats of any kind, whatever point you&apos;re arguing will hold more weight to it vs when you don&apos;t. In this part of the section I am going to pitch why <strong>One Piece</strong> is a really impressive piece of media, without focusing too much on the story or my anecdotal experience with it, but the stats instead.</p>
								 <div class="row">
									 <div class="col-7">
										 <p>First off what is One Piece? apart from being my favorite show of all time, One Piece is originally a Japanese manga<em>(graphic novel or comic)</em> series written and illustrated by <strong>Eiichiro Oda</strong> or as we fans like to call him <strong>&quot;Goda&quot;</strong>, it has been serialized in Shueisha &apos;s shōnen manga magazine <strong>Weekly Shōnen Jump</strong> since July 1997, as of October 2024 it currently has a total of 109 volumes with a combination of 1128 chapters. One Piece also has an anime adaptation with 1122 episodes which is how most people experience the story. It is one of the longest series ever, but unlike most shows of its length there&apos;s a very good reason it is long not limited to the vast world building, hundreds of amazing characters and the vast mysteries, so much that there are people on YouTube who have made a career out of talking about One Piece alone. I&apos;ve personally been following the story closely since 2014, anyone who knows me well enough knows just how much this story means to me.</p>

										 <p>One piece sales volume sales spiked during 2010 and 2011, this was mostly because of the promotion and release of the first big One Piece movie, <strong>Strong world(2010)</strong>, this was also around time the <strong>Marineford</strong> arc was airing in the anime, which is considered by many to be the greatest arc in the story and one of the greatest, if not the greatest arc in all of anime, this is when One Piece was at it&apos;s prime, and there was no better time to become a fan.</p>

										 <p>One piece is the highest selling manga of all time with an approximate of 516.6 million copies sold. For reference <strong>Dragon ball Z</strong> is sitting at no. 5 with 260 million copies sold, and <strong>Naruto</strong> at no. 6 with 250 million, these aren&apos;t low numbers by any means, One Piece just gaps all it&apos;s competition when it comes to sales.</p>
										 <p>In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for <em>&quot;the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author&quot;.</em></p>
									 </div>
									 <div class="col-4">
										 <p>Eiichiro Oda the creator of One Piece is the no. 10th highest selling author of all time in terms of most copies sold, for reference no.1 is <strong>Shakespeare</strong>, <strong>J. K. Rowling</strong> author of <strong>Harry Potter</strong> is no. 8 and <strong>Daniel steel</strong> is no. 4. So yeah, this is an amazing feat in my opinion because Anime and Manga is still a relatively niche medium in the general public compared to other novels.</p>
									 </div>
									 <div class="col-4">
										 <p>One piece has been the best selling manga for 18 years out of the 26 years it has been serialized. It was the best-selling manga every year(copies sold per year) for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, the streak was eventually broken by <strong>Demon slayer</strong> in 2019, I remember being devastated back in 2019 when the news broke out, I was looking for every source wishing it wasn&apos;t true.</p>

										 <p>The amount of One Piece chapters we get a year has been declined gradually which is to be expected, considering the author has been writing and illustrating it for 26+ years, if anything One Piece fans are generally happy when we see the author taking priority of his health and not overworking himself.</p>
										 <p>2020 and 2023 are the lowest of all, 2020 because of the covid-19 pandemic and 2023 because the author was busy working with the Live action adaptation of One Piece.</p>

										 <p>These are the numbers of visits to the one piece page on Wikipaedia, on August 2023 there was a massive spike, this without a doubt due to the release of the One Piece Live Action adaptations which was a huge success and the first successful live action anime adaptation</p>
										 <p>The live action adaptation got many new people into the show and raised the overall interest in the One Piece franchise. It was honestly a great time to be a One Piece fan, I even had some family members discussing it with me which was something I thought would never happen. For now i&apos;m just hoping season 2 will be just as good.</p>

								 <p>The story of One Piece is devided into sagas, each saga focuses on it&apos;s own different themes, conflicts, characters and locations, It is an adventure story after all. You could think of a saga as like a season, but since One Piece is weekly we can&apos;t really use the season metric. Each saga also has it&apos;s own arcs which is essentially the storylines within each saga.</p><canvas id="ArchapterLength" style="width:50%;"><br></canvas>
								 <p>The wano arc is the longest arc in the story, it stared in July 2018, when I was in matric, I remember being very excited when I it began because I had been anticipating it since 2016, It ended in August 2022, I had a beard by the time it ended which I find funny. Most people complain about how long recent arcs have become compared to the earlier arcs, a sentiment I can relate to however, I understand it&apos;s because the One Piece story and world is of a grater magnitude now, there are more characters, more mysteries and bigger conflicts that it would be impossible for everything to be resolved in a few chapters without making some bad writing choices.</p><!-- Graph seven --><canvas id="OPSagas" style="width:100%;"><br></canvas><!-- Graph eight --><canvas id="ArcEpisodeLength" style="width:50%;"><br></canvas>
